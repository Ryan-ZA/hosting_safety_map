hosting_safety_map
==================

A very simple world map using jvectormap that uses crowd sourced data to find which countries are likely to be unsafe for hosting servers due to privacy concerns.

You can view the map at https://rawgithub.com/Ryan-ZA/hosting_safety_map/master/map.html

Help out by submitting a pull request with data on different countries. 
Just edit data.js and add in data by country code.
